## Hello, my name is Jonathan. ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer with a preference for front-end development and mobile app development.
I am a philosophy enthusiast, and enjoy discussing all manner of thought experiments and ideas. I value free speech when used in good faith for intellectual discourse; as such, I do not believe any idea is taboo or above criticism. 
In my younger years I played chess competitively, but I haven't played ever since I completed medical school. These days I indulge in playing videogames, card games, and board games that have an emphasis on strategy and tactical elements.

### I am working or have worked with the following tech to varying degrees:

#### Front-end
